# Traccar Architecture

## Overview

Traccar is designed with a modular architecture that allows for flexibility, extensibility, and scalability. The system is built around a core server component that handles device communication, data processing, and provides a REST API for client applications.

## Core Components

### 1. Server Manager

The ServerManager is responsible for managing protocol implementations and their connections. It dynamically loads protocol classes and maintains connections to GPS devices.

### 2. Protocol Handlers

Traccar supports over 200 GPS protocols through a plugin-like architecture. Each protocol is implemented as a separate class that extends BaseProtocol and provides specific handling for different device types.

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline

The system processes incoming data through a series of handlers:
- **GeolocationHandler**: Determines device location from network information
- **GeocoderHandler**: Converts coordinates to human-readable addresses
- **FilterHandler**: Filters out invalid or redundant positions
- **SpeedLimitHandler**: Adds speed limit information to positions
- **CopyAttributesHandler**: Copies attributes between positions
- **TimeHandler**: Handles time-related processing

### 4. Storage System

Traccar supports multiple database systems through an abstraction layer:
- **DatabaseStorage**: For persistent storage in SQL databases
- **MemoryStorage**: For in-memory storage (testing or small deployments)

### 5. Web Server

The WebServer component provides a REST API and serves the web interface. It's built on Jetty and uses Jersey for REST API implementation.

### 6. Notification System

The notification system supports various channels:
- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- Web notifications
- Push notifications to mobile apps

### 7. Integration Services

Traccar provides several integration points:
- **EventForwarder**: Forwards events to external systems
- **PositionForwarder**: Forwards position data to external systems
- **BroadcastService**: Broadcasts messages between server instances

## Dependency Injection

Traccar uses Google Guice for dependency injection, which allows for a modular and testable codebase. The MainModule class configures all the components and their dependencies.

## Communication Flow

1. GPS devices send data to the Traccar server using their specific protocols
2. The server processes the data through the protocol handlers
3. The data is then processed through the data processing pipeline
4. Processed data is stored in the database
5. Notifications are sent if configured triggers are met
6. Client applications can access the data through the REST API

## Scalability

Traccar can be scaled in several ways:
- Vertical scaling by increasing server resources
- Horizontal scaling using load balancers and multiple server instances
- Database scaling through replication and sharding

## Security

The system implements several security measures:
- Authentication through username/password, API keys, or external providers (LDAP, OpenID)
- Authorization with role-based access control
- HTTPS support for secure communication
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
